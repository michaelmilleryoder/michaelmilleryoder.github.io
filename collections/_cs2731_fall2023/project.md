# Final Project (CS 2731 Fall 2023)
A major component of this course is a hands-on final project guided by students' own interests. In this project, students will demonstrate an ability to summarize and implement current approaches and challenges in a subfield of NLP and make a contribution to this NLP research area.

## Groups
Projects will be done by 1-3 students, usually 2 students. Groups will be assigned by the instructor and TA based on interests and skills from a survey. Students can also email the instructor and TA with group preferences.

## Deliverables
1. **Project survey**. This survey asks about NLP research areas of interest, skills, and any project ideas. The survey will be available as a Google Form.
2. **Project area**. You will provide the type of contribution you are interested in pursuing within a specific research area via a form. The instructor and TA will provide some feedback on this direction.
3. **Literature review**. This literature review will be of papers relevant to your project area. It will group and summarize relevant papers into types of tasks, datasets, and/or approaches.
4. **Project proposal**. This proposal will be a report with answers to the following questions:
	1. What type of contribution are you making?
	2. What is the problem or task you are focusing on?
	3. What is the nature of your contribution?
	4. How does your contribution build on or extend prior work?
	5. What data are you using (or contributing)?
	6. What algorithm or approach are you taking to address the task?
	7. How are you evaluating your contribution? What performance metrics are you going to use?
	8. What kinds of ethical issues may be raised by your model or data?
The instructor and TA will provide feedback on this proposal.
5. **Project proposal presentation**. Groups will make a brief presentation to the class outlining their proposed project, with Q&A and opportunities for feedback from other students.
6. **Basic working system**. A brief (1-2 page) progress report of a basic working system. Not everything needs to be done or fully functional, but there needs to be some sort of basic functionality. This report should be in the ACL format that the final report will be in.
7. **Final report and code**. At the end of the course, groups will provide a written report of their project. This report will be in the ACL format found [here](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files) (Overleaf template [here](https://www.overleaf.com/project/5f64f1fb97c4c50001b60549)).

## Types of contributions
Your goal is to make a contribution, even a small one, to NLP research or practice. You can select from the following types of contributions, combine multiple of them, or define a different type of contribution with instructor approval.

1. *New dataset and/or new annotation*. This often accompanies the introduction of a new NLP task, which could be a previously unstudied phenomenon (e.g. ["verifiability"](https://aclanthology.org/I17-1076.pdf)).

2. *Methods contribution*. This is perhaps the most common sort of NLP research contribution, in which a new method or algorithm for approaching a task is presented.
