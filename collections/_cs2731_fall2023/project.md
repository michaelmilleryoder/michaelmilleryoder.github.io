# Final Project (CS 2731 Fall 2023)
A major component of this course is a hands-on final project guided by students' own interests. In this project, students will demonstrate an ability to summarize and implement current approaches and challenges in a subfield of NLP and make a contribution to this NLP research area.

## Groups
Projects will be done by 1-3 students, usually 2 students. Groups will be assigned by the instructor and TA based on interests and skills from a survey. Students can also email the instructor and TA with group preferences.

## Deliverables
1. **Project survey**. This survey asks about NLP research areas of interest, skills, and any project ideas. The survey will be available as a Google Form.
2. **Project area**. Students will complete a basic form asking about the type of contribution they are interested in pursuing within a specific research area. The instructor and TA will provide some feedback on this direction.
3. **Literature review**. Students will complete a literature review related to their project area that groups and summarizes relevant aspects of papers into types of tasks, datasets, and/or approaches.
4. **Project proposal**. This proposal will be a report with answers to the following questions:
	1. What type of contribution are you making?
	2. What is the problem or task you are focusing on?
	3. What is the nature of your contribution?
	4. How does your contribution build on or extend prior work?
	5. What data are you using (or contributing)?
	6. What algorithm or approach are you taking to address the task?
	7. How are you evaluating your contribution? What performance metrics are you going to use?
	8. What kinds of ethical issues may be raised by your model or data?
4. **Basic working system**. A brief report and code of a basic working system. Not everything needs to be done or fully functional, but there needs to be some sort of basic functionality.
