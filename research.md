## About my research

Language in use conveys much more than information. The words we use display something about who is talking, what the situation may be, and even how certain speakers, communities or concepts are being positioned. Influence, politeness, censorship and identity are examples of these "other," more social, constructs that are partially visible through language.

I use computational methods to analyze, measure and predict these social factors in language. The goal of my resarch is to more fully understand how social constructs are both reflected and come into being through language. My research draws on computational linguistics, sociolinguistics and discourse analysis.
