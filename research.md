## About my research

Language conveys much more than information. The words we use show something about who we are, what the situation is, who is being spoken to, and even what the relationship might be between discourse participants. Influence, politeness, censorship, privilege and identity are examples of social constructs that I'm interested in looking at through language.

I use machine learning and other computational methods to measure, analyze and predict these social factors in language. The goal of my research is to more fully understand how social constructs are both reflected and come into being through language. My research draws on computational linguistics, sociolinguistics and discourse analysis.
