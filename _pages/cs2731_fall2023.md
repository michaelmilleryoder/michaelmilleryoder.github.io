# Course description
Computer programs that automatically process human language, such as chatbots, translation systems, and speech recognition systems, have rapidly become a part of everyday life. This course provides an introduction to the artificial intelligence research field that brought about these systems: natural language processing (NLP). Students will become familiar with foundational tasks in NLP such as language modeling, text classification, and sequence modeling. The course will cover both classic and contemporary approaches to these tasks, as well as how they are applied in language technologies. Topics of ethics, fairness, and bias in AI are incorporated throughout the course.

# Learning objectives
The overarching learning objective of this course is for students to be able to structure an NLP system to get a desired outcome from text data that may be required in a future job or research problem. This ability requires the development of many constituent skills. At the end of the course, students will be able to:
* Relate a new problem to the most relevant existing NLP tasks, such as text classification, text generation, sequence modeling, language modeling, information retrieval, machine translation, dialogue systems, etc.
* Choose relevant baseline machine learning approaches to try on a new task
* Explain the basics of language structure that are relevant to NLP. These include syntax and semantics from linguistics
* Preprocess text data into a machine-readable format
* Define and scope an objective in terms of a machine learning or NLP system. This includes determining if human annotation is needed and if machine learning is needed.
* Extract features from text that are required for running machine learning models
* Choose suitable ML algorithms for a new NLP task
* Evaluate machine learning algorithms, choices of training data and other NLP system decisions
* Identify potential ethical pitfalls (such as imbalanced training data, model amplification of biases) in an NLP system and ways to address them

# Learning resources
**Textbook**: Dan Jurafsky and James H. Martin, Speech and Language Processing, 3rd edition draft, 2023-01-07. Available completely free online: [https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/)

**Software and programming languages**: Python and associated data science libraries (pandas, numpy, scipy) are the preferred software for completing coding portions of homework assignments. Students wishing to use non-Python tools for homeworks should ask the instructor first. Final projects may be completed with any programming language or tools.

# Course infrastructure
The most recent syllabus, including a schedule, will be posted on the course website. This syllabus will contain links to homework and final project descriptions. Homeworks and the final project should be submitted through Canvas. Quizzes and discussion boards will be on Canvas. Course announcements will be given on Canvas, and questions should be submitted through Canvas (or over email to the instructor or TA).
